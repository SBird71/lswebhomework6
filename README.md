# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions
		A function is a chunk of code that allows us to perform a task. We can put the function together, like gathering ingredients to make a sandwich, but the task is not performed until the function is called, like a sandwich is not made until the ingredients are put together.
	* Parameters
		Parameters are the (as of yet, unspecified) conditions with which we are passing through the function. If we knew we were going to make a sandwich, we would then have to decide what would go on it. Cheese? Meat? These are the parameters.
	* Arguments
		Up until now, the parameters were unspecified, kind of like placeholders. after the function is called, and when we give parameters a value, they are called arguments. Not just any cheese, provologne cheese. Not just any meat, chicken.
	* `if` statements
		If statements are used as a test to see if something is true or not. If it is true, then something happens. If it is not true, then something different happens.

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
